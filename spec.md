*INITIAL DRAFT* (to be replaced by the version number)

The **m**acro**m**olecular **t**ransmission **f**ormat (MMTF) is a binary encoding of biological structures. It includes the coordinates, the topology and associated data. Pronounced goals are a reduced file size for efficient transmission over the Internet or from hard disk to memory and fast decoding/parsing speed. Additionally the format aims to be easy to understand and implement to facilitates its dissemination.

## Container

The [fields](#fields) in MMTF are stored in a binary container format. The top-level of the container contains the field names as keys and field data as values. To describe the layout of data in MMTF we use [JSON](http://www.json.org/) throughout this document. The following table lists all top level [fields](#fields), including their [type](#types) and whether they are required or optional.

The MessagePack format (version 5) is used as the binary container format of MMTF. The MessagePack [specification](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md) describes the data types and the data layout. Encoding and decoding libraries for MessagePack are available in many languages, see the MessagePack [website](http://msgpack.org/).

While MessagePack supports 64-bit Unsigned/Signed Integers they are forbidden in MMTF as they can not be represented natively in JavaScript. This is especially important for `userData` fields otherwise all MessagePack types are allowed (Note that the current version of the MMTF specification does not include `userData` fields but they may be added in the future).

The first step of decoding MMTF is decoding the MessagePack encoded container. Many of the resulting MMTF fields do not need to be decoded any further. However, to allow for custom compression some fields are given as binary data and must be decoded using the strategies described below.


## Encodings

The following encoding strategies are used to compress the data contained in MMTF files.


### Run-length encoding

Run-length decoding can generally be used to compress lists that contain stretches of equal values. Instead of storing each value itself, stretches of equal values are represented by the value itself and the occurrence count, that is a value/count pair.

*Examples*:

Starting with the encoded list of value/count pairs. In the following example there are three pairs `1, 10`, `2, 1` and `1, 4`. The first entry in a pair is the value to be repeated and the second entry denotes how often the value must be repeated.

```JSON
[ 1, 10, 2, 1, 1, 4 ]
```

Applying run-length decoding by repeating, for each pair, the value as often as denoted by the count entry.

```JSON
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]
```

Another example that has strings instead of numbers as values:

```JSON
[ "A", 5, "B", 2 ]
```

Applying run-length decoding:

```JSON
[ "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B" ]
```


### Delta encoding

Delta encoding is used to store lists of numbers. Instead of storing the numbers themselves, the differences (deltas) between the numbers are stored. When the values of the deltas are smaller than the numbers themselves they can be more efficiently packed to require less space.

Note that lists which change by an identical amount for a range of consecutive values lend themselves to subsequent run-length encoding.

*Example*:

Starting with the encoded list of delta values:

```JSON
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]
```

Applying delta decoding. The first entry in the list is left as is, the second is calculated as the sum of the first and the second (not decoded) value, the third as the sum of the second (decoded) and third (not decoded) value and so forth.

```JSON
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 ]
```


#### Split-list delta encoding

Split-list delta encoding is an adjusted delta encoding to handle lists with some intermittent large delta values. The list is split into two arrays, called "big" and "small". The "big" `Int32Array` holds pairs of a large delta value (>=2^15) and the number of subsequent small delta values (<2^15). The "small" `Int16Array` holds the small values, that is, the values fitting into a 16-bit Signed Integer.

*Example*:

Starting with the "big" `Int32Array` and the "small `Int16Array`":

```JavaScript
[ 1200, 3, 100, 2 ]  // big
[ 0, 2, -1, -3, 5 ]  // small
```

Applying split-list delta decoding to create a `Int32Array`:

```JSON
[ 1200, 1200, 1202, 1201, 1301, 1298, 1303 ]
```


### Integer encoding

In integer encoding, floating point numbers are converted to integer values by multiplying with a factor and discard everything after the decimal point. Depending on the multiplication factor this can change the precision but with a sufficiently large factor it is lossless. The integer values can then often be compressed with delta encoding which is the main motivation for it.

*Example*:

Starting with the list of integer values:

```JSON
[ 100, 100, 100, 100, 50, 50 ]
```

Applying integer decoding with a divisor of `100`:

```JSON
[ 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 0.50, 0.50 ]
```


### Dictionary encoding

For dictionary encoding a `Map` is created to store key-value pairs. References to the keys can then be used instead of repeating the values over and over again. Lists of keys can afterwards be compressed with delta and run-length encoding.

*Example*:

First create a `Map` to hold values that are referable by keys. In the following example the are two keys, `1` and `2` with some values associated.

```JSON
{
    "1": {
        "A": [ 1, 2, 3 ],
        "B": "HELLO"
    },
    "2": {
        "A": [ 4, 5, 6 ],
        "B": "HEY"
    }
}
```

The keys can then be used to reference the values as often as needed:

```JSON
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 ]
```

Note that in the above example the list of keys can also be efficiently run-length encoded:

```JSON
[ 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3 ]
```


## Types

### String

An ASCII encoded 8-bit string of up to (2^32)-1 characters.


### Float32

A 32-bit Floating Point number.


### Uint32

An Unsigned 32-bit Integer number.


### Int32

### TypedArray

Typed arrays are not directly supported by the `msgpack` format. However it is straightforward to work with arrays of simple numeric types by re-interpreting the binary data in a `BinaryArray`. For example, for a `Float32Array` groups of 4 bytes of a `BinaryArray` are interpreted as a 32-bit floating point numbers. Multi-byte types are always represented in big-endian format.

### Model data

The number of models in a structure is equal to the length of the `chainsPerModel` field. The `chainsPerModel` field also defines which chains belong to each model.


#### chainsPerModel

*Required field*

*Type*: `Array` of `Uint32` numbers. The number of models is thus equal to the length of the `chainsPerModel` field.

*Description*: List of the number of chains in each model.

*Example*:

In the following example there are 2 models. The first model has 5 chains and the second model has 8 chains. This also means that the chains with indices 0 to 4 belong to the first model and that the chains with indices 5 to 12 belong to the second model.

```JSON
[ 5, 8 ]
```


### Chain data

The number of chains in a structure is equal to the length of the `groupsPerChain` field. The `groupsPerChain` field also defines which groups belong to each chain.


#### groupsPerChain

*Required field*

*Type*: `Array` of `Uint32` numbers.

*Description*: List of the number of groups (aka residues) in each chain. The number of chains is thus equal to the length of the `groupsPerChain` field.

*Example*:

In the following example there are 3 chains. The first chain has 73 groups, the second 59 and the third 1. This also means that the groups with indices 0 to 72 belong to the first chain, groups with indices 73 to 131 to the second chain and the group with index 132 to the third chain.

```JSON
[ 73, 59, 1 ]
```


#### chainIdList

*Required field*

*Type*: `BinaryArray` that is interpreted as an `Uint8Array` representing ASCII characters.

*Decoding*: Groups of four consecutive ASCII characters create the list of chain IDs. Note that the decoding here is optional, a decoding library may choose to pass the `Uint8Array` on for performance reasons. Nevertheless we describe all the steps for complete decoding here as an illustration.

*Description*: List of chain IDs. The IDs here are used to reference the chains from other fields.

*Example*:

Starting with the `BinaryArray`/`Uint8Array`:

```JSON
[ 0, 0, 0, 65, 0, 0, 0, 66, 0, 0, 89, 67 ]
```

Decoding the ASCII characters:

```JSON
[ "", "", "", "A", "", "", "", "B", "", "", "Y", "C" ]
```

Creating the list of chain IDs:

```JSON
[ "A", "B", "YC" ]
```


#### chainNameList

*Optional field*

*Type*: `BinaryArray` that is interpreted as an `Uint8Array` representing ASCII characters.

*Decoding*: Same as for the `chainIdList` field.

*Description*: List of chain names. This field allows to specify an additional set of labels for chains. For example, it can be used to store both, the `label_asym_id` (in `chainIdList`) and the `auth_asym_id` (in `chainNameList`) from `mmCIF` files.


### Group data

#### groupMap

*Required field*

*Type*: `Map` of `groupType` entries. A `groupType` object has the following fields:

- `atomCharges` is an `Array`  of `Int32` holding the formal charges of each atom.
- `atomInfo` is an `Array` of `String`s alternating between the element (0 to 3 characters) and the atom name (0 to 5 characters). The element name must follow the IUPAC standard where only the first character is capitalized and the remaining ones are lower case, for instance `Cd` for Cadmium.
- `bondIndices` is an `Array` of `Int32` pairs representing indices of covalently bonded atoms. The indices point to the `atomInfo`/`atomCharges` lists.
- `bondOrders` is an `Array` of `Int32` denoting the order for each bond in `bondIndices`. Must be a value between 1 and 3. Only covalent bonds may be given.
- `chemCompType` is a `String` .
- `groupName` is a `String` holding the of the name of the group (0 to 5 characters).
- `singleLetterCode` is a `String` of length one, representing the IUPAC single letter code for protein or DNA/RNA residues, otherwise the character 'X'.

*Description*: Common group (residue) data that is referenced via the `groupType` key by group entries.

*Vocabulary*: Known values for the groupType field `chemCompType` from the [mmCIF dictionary](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/mmcif_pdbx_v40.dic/Items/_chem_comp.type.html) are `D-beta-peptide, C-gamma linking`, `D-gamma-peptide, C-delta linking`, `D-peptide COOH carboxy terminus`, `D-peptide NH3 amino terminus`, `D-peptide linking`, `D-saccharide`, `D-saccharide 1,4 and 1,4 linking`, `D-saccharide 1,4 and 1,6 linking`, `DNA OH 3 prime terminus`, `DNA OH 5 prime terminus`, `DNA linking`, `L-DNA linking`, `L-RNA linking`, `L-beta-peptide, C-gamma linking`, `L-gamma-peptide, C-delta linking`, `L-peptide COOH carboxy terminus`, `L-peptide NH3 amino terminus`, `L-peptide linking`, `L-saccharide`, `L-saccharide 1,4 and 1,4 linking`, `L-saccharide 1,4 and 1,6 linking`, `RNA OH 3 prime terminus`, `RNA OH 5 prime terminus`, `RNA linking`, `non-polymer`, `other`, `peptide linking`, `peptide-like`, `saccharide`.

*Note*: The `groupMap` field is a `Map` instead of an `Array` to allow having (in the future) a global `Map` within the decoder that is only supplemented with a sparse map in the file.

*Example*:

```JSON
{
    "0": {
        "atomCharges": [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
        "atomInfo": [ "N", "N", "C", "CA", "C", "C", "O", "O" ],
        "bondIndices": [ 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2 ],
        "bondOrders": [ 1, 1, 2 ],
