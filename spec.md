# MMTF Sepcification

The **m**acro**m**olecular **t**ransmission **f**ormat (MMTF) is a binary encoding of biological structures. It includes the coordinates, the topology and associated data. Pronounced goals are a reduced file size for efficient transmission over the Internet or from hard disk to memory and fast decoding/parsing speed. Additionally the format aims to be easy to understand and implement to facilitates its dissemination.



## Remarks

- Msgpack (v5) as container format, see [msgpack spec](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md).
- Encoded, binary fields are stored as big-endian when applicable (16/32-bit un/signed integers, 16/32/64 floats).
- 64-bit un/signed integers in custom fields are forbidden as they can not represented natively in JavaScript.
- Some fields are optional.

## Encodings

### Integer encoding

- Convert floating point numbers to integers by multiplying with a factor and discard everything after the decimal point.
- Depending on the multiplication factor this can change the precision but with a sufficiently large factor it is lossless.
- The Integers can then often be compressed with delta encoding which is the main motivation for it.


### Delta encoding

- For lists of numbers.
- Store differences (deltas) between numbers instead of the numbers themselves.
- When the deltas are smaller than the numbers themselves they can be packed to require less space.
- Lists that change by an identical amount for a range of consecutive values lend themselves to subsequent run-length encoding.


#### Split-list delta encoding

- Special handling of lists with intermittent large delta values
- The list is split into two arrays to store the values
	- An array of 32-bit signed integers holds pairs of a large delta value and the number of subsequent small delta values
	- An array of 16-bit signed integers holds the small values


### Run-length encoding

- For lists of values that support a equality comparison.
- Represent stretches of equal values by the value itself and the occurrence count.


### Dictionary encoding

- Create a key-value store and use the key instead of repeating the value over and over again.
- Lists of keys can afterwards be compressed with delta and run-length encoding.

## Extra

Some useful values are not explicitly included as a field in the `msgpack` but can easily derived from other fields.

- Residue count is length of `resOrder` field.
- Chain count is length of `groupsPerChain` field.
- Model count is length of `chainsPerModel` field.
